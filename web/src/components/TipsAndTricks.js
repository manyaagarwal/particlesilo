    question: "What is science communication? What are the goals?",
    answer: "The most famous definition of science communication might be the one by Burns et al. (2003) where they explain science communication as the appropriate use of skills, media, activities and dialogue in a way of producing one, or more, of the following personal responses to science (the vowel analogy): (1) awareness, that includes familiarity with the new aspects of science; (2) enjoyment or other affective response in order to enjoy science as art or entertainment; (3) interest, highlighted by the voluntary involvement with science or its communication; (4) opinions formation, reformulation or confirmation of attitudes related to science; and (5) understanding of science, its content, processes and social factors.",

    question: "How can I identify my audience?",
    answer: "It is important that you know how to identify the audience you are communicating to so you can communicate the topics you want  properly. There are many possible audiences inside a population so you must ask “who am I communicating to?” \n \n When looking at the audience, it is important that you always consider the non-scientific public as being made of by people that are not experts in the area. Members of the public can differ in age, interests, experiences, opinions and academic background but, many of the times they are not completely lay in the theme.\n \n It is important that you verify if, inside the audience, there is more specific audiences (e.g., more elderly people, teenagers, children) and if you have access to more detailed information that allow you to adapt your communication to a more targeted audience (e.g., interests, financial background, geographical localisation). \n \n Besides the importance of identifying the audience , it is also important that you know how to characterize it - the more information you have about the audience, the bigger is the chance of adapting  the message correctly - and segment the audience - to segment an audience is to turn it into small groups with similar interests, behavioural patterns and needs.\n \n In order to properly segment the audience you must previously define the criteria that will characterize these groups. This will allow the groups to be the more homogenous possible, you can use: \n \u2022 Sociodemographic data (e.g., age, academic background, gender) \n \u2022 Geographic localisation (e.g., region, district, country) \n \u2022 Psychosocial data (e.g., values, interests, attitudes)",

    question: "How should I communicate with a non-scientific audience?",
    answer: "In a more general way, in order to communicate with all the segments inside a non-scientific audience - and considering all the differences that might exist - consider the following: \n \u2022 Use analogies and visual content \n \u2022 Respect the previous knowledge of the public \n \u2022  Begin with more broad topics and then pass into more complex topics \n \u2022 Begin with the topics that interest to the less specialized public in the audience \n \n One example where you can use this tips is on talks, or public events, where you need to reach a more broad audience. Normally, on these events, you can’t specify the different audiences and must assume that the audience has little knowledge on the theme. This way, you can avoid losing the audience during your talk. You can also reach all the audience members in the same way. \n \n If you want,  using  stories, or narratives, is a good method to involve the public in a topic. Normally, these help the public in comprehending how science works and you can \‘win\’ the public\'s trust. Some tips to use on the storytelling process: \n \u2022 Keep the story simple \n \u2022 Make the story relevant and with meaning to the public \n \u2022 Train the story beforehand so you can try different ways of keeping the public attention \n \u2022 Avoid complex or scientific words, it is essential that you use simple language (but not too simple) \n \u2022 Include people and the process (with whom you collaborated, the successes and challenges) \n \u2022 Use humour, it helps to turn the environment more casual and attract the audience\'s attention (but be careful with the humour and train it with friends and colleagues beforehand!)",

    question: "How should I communicate with a very specific audience such as children?",
    answer: "Sometimes you can be confronted with some specific audiences like children or adolescents. You must adapt your communication to the characteristics of these audiences. \n \n It is important that when communicating with children you consider the environment where you are going to be. Normally, science communication events with children happen in two places: at school - where the environment is more formal, or at events where the environment is more informal (e.g., science fairs). \n \n When communinicating in formal environments try to: \n \u2022 Involve the person responsible for the children in the process(e.g., professor, school principal) in the process \n \u2022 Get the opinion of teachers, or other professionals in the education area, about the topic you are about to communicate. This way you can consider the previous knowledge they might have \n \u2022 Establish boundaries so you don’t allow the environment to get too informal \n \u2022 Stay on time (avoid that getting students \'stuck\' students at lunchtime or after school) \n \u2022 Don\’t be afraid of unexpected questions, after all, you are the one that knows more about the topic! \n \u2022 Prepare for all scenarios and for the unexpected! It is very likely that personal questions might emerge. As a scientist, children have a special interest in your work and your life! \n \n When communicating in informal environments try to: \n \u2022 Verify, or question, if children are going to be accompanied by a    teacher or responsible person. This way you can consider how their behaviour might vary with the presence - or absence - of an authority figure \n \u2022 If your activity is not inserted at a science fair, but for example in a museum, remember children might not be expecting a science-related activity at this place. Use this surprise factor to catch their attention and show that science is everywhere! \n \u2022 The number of people that might show up for your communication/activity can vary - you can have more people than expected but also fewer people. Prepare yourself for both scenarios. Tip: if you have more participants than expected prepare to work with the group as one big audience. In case you get fewer people than expected, prepare to dedicate more time to each participant",

    question: "How can I adapt my message and make it more attractive?",
    answer: "After you know your audience, you must prepare your message considering its characteristics. It is important that your message can answer the following questions of the audience: \'so what?\'' and \'why should I care?\'.  Don’t forget that the answer to these questions might change with the audience! \n \n Your message should be framed in order to accomplish the following: \n \u2022 Accessible language \n \u2022 Include topics with which every person can relate to (with knowledge on the  area or not) \n \u2022 Include topics with meaning to the audience \n \n Tips to make your message more attractive to the audience: \n \u2022 Use active verbs \n \u2022 Avoid complex words, euphemisms, cliches or word games \n \u2022 Use analogies and examples \n \u2022 Include only the most critical and important details \n \u2022 Create a draft \n \u2022 Tell a story but keep it true to the facts \n \u2022 Reread and rewrite the message the number of times you feel is needed \n \u2022 Always cite your sources! \n \n When talking about science, don't forget to: \n \u2022 Take time to prepare yourself and train your communication \n \u2022 Reinforce your main message in the beginning and in the end of the presentation \n \u2022 Focus on the most important aspects that might be more interesting and relevant to the audience \n \u2022 Involve the audience with questions and dialogue \n \u2022 Use different resources (e.g. visual information, posters) and explain them \n \u2022 Talk about the process and not only about the results \n \u2022 Try to use less time than the time that was given to you \n \u2022 Leave time for questions! \n \u2022 Try to know the audience and guess what kind of questions they might ask so you can prepare the answers",

  {
    question: "How can I use different resources to interact with the audience?",
    answer: "In order to prepare yourself for a talk, conference or event, you can use many of the available resources. These resources will help you attract the audience\'s attention and to communicate your message. \n \n The resources you can use go from a simple talk, visual demonstrations (e.g. map projections, graphics, infographics, photos, videos, posters) to experiments (hands-on activities). \n \n The visual material you use to communicate with different audiences might be very different from the ones you use on scientific presentations, so: \n \u2022 Use consistent format and style \n \u2022 Use colours with a goal \n \u2022 Use high-resolution graphics \n \u2022 Format the graphics and include legends, names and phrases \n \n The most common visual materials to communicate science are graphics (infographics), concepts diagrams, photographs, maps, tables or a combining of many of these on a poster, newsletter or presentation. \n \n Poster presentation tips: \n \u2022 Use the right editorial software so the poster looks uniform (e.g. font, graphics) \n \u2022 The title must always be originated by the message \n \u2022 Choose colours intentionally \n \u2022 Use high-resolution visual material \n \u2022 Use concept diagrams for the less specialized audiences \n \u2022 Use text to support the visual material \n \n Slideshow presentation tips: \n \u2022 Slides are supposed to help your presentation and not dominate it \n \u2022 Using slides appropriately will make your presentation more impactful and involving \n \u2022 Be sure you use the visual material adequately so it doesn’t distract the audience \n \u2022 Spend 2 to 3 minutes per slide \n \u2022 Each slide should have a visual element \n \u2022 Explain the visual material to the audience",

    question: "How can I use the media?",
    answer: "Media reveal themselves as mediators between scientists and the public. And it is important to bear in mind that these are not a homogeneous group! Interests and content can vary from newspapers to television, more general documentaries or magazines. Communicating with the media ensures that your research can reach readers, the government officials and other scientists. \n \n Tips on how to work with the media: \n \u2022 Read some press releases so you can understand how your investigation may be portrayed and which parts you should include or not \n \u2022 Read science articles with some popularity in order to understand how your investigation can be portrayed in newspapers and magazines \n \u2022 Analyse the different media so you can make a selection of those where you think your research better fits in - remember quantity is not quality! It is essential that you know where to place your research so you don\'t spread it without a strategy \n \u2022 Inform yourself about media training so you can be prepared if you have to go to television shows (live or not). This way you will know basic tips on how to deal with journalists in any environment (eg, television, conferences, interviews etc.) \n \n Before going to media interviews, ask yourself: \n \u2022 What kind of publication/show is it? \n \u2022 Who is the main audience? \n \u2022 Has the journalist/presenter already dealt with this topic? Will they have a bias? \n \u2022 Will there be more than one journalist? \n \u2022 Where does my point of view fit in the story? \n \u2022 What is the format of the interview?",

    question: "Can I use social networks to communicate science?",
    answer: "You can and you should! \n \n It is important that you consider that currently we are increasingly dependent on technologies. Meaning that, it is important that researchers are easily found online, either by the scientific public (eg, colleagues from other areas) or by the non-scientific public (eg, people who heard about your work on the media, who had a lecture from you, among others). \n \n Maintaining a reputation on social media, or the web in general, is the responsibility of each scientist. It is essential that you control the personal information spread over the internet so you can create consistency on how you are presented. \n \n Why you should take care of your reputation on the web: \n \u2022 So you can be contacted by any person, institution, company or media \n \u2022 To develop your own identity \n \u2022 So you can organise your personal information \n \u2022 To have a bigger community that follows your work \n \u2022 To expand your personal brand \n \n It is important that you know how to distinguish between personal social networks and professional social networks. Personal social networks include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube, among others, while professional social networks are sites such as LinkedIn, Google Scholar, ResearchGate and Academia.edu. As you can see, there are several social networks and it is important that you know which makes sense to be in - it is not necessary to be present in all! In order to choose the most appropriate social network(s), it is essential to ask the following questions: \n \u2022 Who do you want to communicate with? \n \u2022 Who do you want your audience to be? \n \u2022 What kind of activities do you want to be involved in? Writing? Finding and sharing links? Collaborating with scientists? Reaching a non-scientific audience? \n \u2022 How much time do you want to spend on social media? \n \n Remember that you are not expected to immediately become a star on social networks! Join conversations, exchange existing ideas, comment on other people's content and gradually start building an audience/group of followers. \n \n Don't forget to cross-promote! If you write on a blog, connect that content to social networks like Twitter or Facebook.",
